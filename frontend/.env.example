# Backend API URL

# For Docker (accessing from browser on host machine)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# For production deployment
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com

# Note: NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix makes this variable available in the browser
# The browser needs to access the API, so use a URL the browser can reach:
# - localhost:3001 for Docker/local development
# - Public URL for production deployment
